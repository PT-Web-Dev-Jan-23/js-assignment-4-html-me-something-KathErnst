         <h3>Nate</h3>
         <p>I met my husband, Nate, about 8 years ago. Our mutual friend suggested many times that we should date. 
            One day when he and some friends came over to my apartment, I cooked a pizza and set off the smoke detector. 
            I propped open the door off the side of the kitchen, only to realize about an hour later that my roommate's 
            cat &quot;Puttu&quot; was missing.

            After searching down the streets and alley surrounding my building, we gave it up as a lost cause. I tried 
            to think about the best way I could apologize to my roommate for having lost her cat. Then Nate called me. He 
            said he saw a cat that looked exactly like Puttu run across the street, and he was following it. I joined him 
            and we went on a two-hour long adventure through my South City neighborhood, trying to catch this cat.

            When it finally ran under a wood fence, we could not follow anymore. I trudged back to my apartment and found 
            my roommate sitting on the couch with Puttu. Nate and I had been chasing a stray around the neighborhood 
            the entire time! We started dating about a week later.

         <h3>Brighton</h3>
         <p>My daughter, Brighton, is 5 years old, and she will probably be your president some day. She will not leave the 
            house in anything other than a dress, her favorite color is &quot;purpleish-pink&quot; and she adores listening to 
            audiobooks, dancing ballet, and painting beautiful watercolor. She is in pre-Kindergarten this year. Here are a few
            of Brighton's favorite things:

         <h3>Ellis</h3>
         <p>My son, Ellis, is 3 years old, and we frequently call him our &quot;house monster.&quot; He is absolutely the sweetest, 
            and also totally wild. He loves dinosaurs, dragons, and anything that roars (as long as it's not too too loud). 
            Ellis has a great ear for rhythm and pitch and sings or hums constantly. If there is something around to climb 
            and jump off, he will try it out and almost always land it. His favorite songs are &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot; and &quot;We are the 
            Dinosaurs.&quot; Check them out:
